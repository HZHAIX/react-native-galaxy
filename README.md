This is a collection of my best practice for creating React Native App

## 1. Integrate `module resolver` in your app

Run `yarn add babel-plugin-module-resolver` and config you alias in `babel.config.js`.

## 2. Use `react-native debugger`

Integrate `react-native debugger` into the project, then it will be easy debug action and state.
